## Technologies and tools used:

When developing the project, I tried to use libraries about which my knowledge was at a basic level. I decided to use them mainly to learn new tools.

- Node v18.15.0
- NPM v9.5.0
- React (create-react-app)
- Chakra UI
- Formik
- Yup
- Axios

I spent about 6-7h on creating the project, mostly reading documentation and learning new libraries.
